Dear Madam, Dear Sir,

I just want to inform you about some details about the order.

I will bear the risk and promise not to make complaints about all parts that are under 4mm width.

I acknowledge the pcb has a high risk of breaking due to the narrow space (0.8mm << 4mm ) between cutouts and furthermore due to the small thickness (0.8mm) of the pcb.

And also with the vias which accentuate the risk of breaking.

The board is just one single pcb which is a reticulated part (a grid).

I also know I will pay an extra cost for the long time process due to the numerous areas to drill.

Yours faithfully,
